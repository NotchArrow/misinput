# About
A simple clientside mod that allows you to setup a list of players that you do not want to attack. If you attempt to hit a player in the list that you configure, then the mod will cancel the action. The list of usernames will save across sessions, servers, and worlds. It's easily configurable when someone steals your diamonds.

`/misinput add (username)` - Add a username to the list

`/misinput list` - List all of the usernames alphabetically

`/misinput remove (username)` - Remove a username from the list
